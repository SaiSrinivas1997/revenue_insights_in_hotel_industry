# Revenue Insights for Hotel Business





## Overview
The goal of this Power BI project is to create a dashboard that provides revenue insights for the hotel industry. The dashboard will display key metrics that hotel owners and managers can use to understand the revenue performance of their hotels, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard will be designed with a focus on revenue management, and will include visualizations that highlight revenue performance by room type, location, and time period. It will also include visualizations that show revenue segmentation by source, such as online travel agencies, direct bookings, and group sales.

The final deliverable will be a Power BI report that can be shared with key stakeholders and used to inform revenue management strategies.

Overall, this project aims to provide an accessible and actionable view of hotel revenue insights, helping hotel owners and managers make informed decisions that improve their bottom line.
